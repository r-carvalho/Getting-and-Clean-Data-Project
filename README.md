# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. At this repo you can find the R script: run_analysis.R that download from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones a data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The R script run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses according to the Assignment request:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Moreover, this repo cotains a codebook to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, and other relevant information. It also contain an independent tidy data set: tidy.txt generated from the data analysis according to the step 5 from the assignment request.
